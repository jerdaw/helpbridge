#### English Error Message Improvements

**Before:**

```json
"noResults": "No results found for \"{query}\".",
"noLocalResults": "No local services found for this search.",
"placeholder": "Search for help..."
```

**After:**

```json
"noResults": "No services found for \"{query}\". Try using different keywords, browsing categories below, or checking your spelling.",
"noLocalResults": "No local Kingston services match this search. Try browsing province-wide services or use different keywords.",
"placeholder": "Search for food, housing, crisis support, health services...",
"searchHint": "Try: food bank, mental health, housing, legal aid"
```

**New Helper Messages:**

```json
"noResultsHelpTitle": "Can't find what you need?",
"noResultsHelpBrowse": "Browse categories below",
"noResultsHelpDifferentWords": "Try different keywords (e.g., \"food assistance\" instead of \"groceries\")",
"noResultsHelpCheckSpelling": "Check your spelling",
"noResultsHelpBroaderSearch": "Search for a broader topic (e.g., \"health\" instead of \"diabetes clinic\")"
```

#### French Error Message Improvements

**Before:**

```json
"noResults": "Aucun résultat trouvé pour \"{query}\".",
"noLocalResults": "Aucun service local trouvé pour cette recherche.",
"placeholder": "Chercher de l'aide..."
```

**After:**

```json
"noResults": "Aucun service trouvé pour \"{query}\". Essayez des mots-clés différents, parcourez les catégories ci-dessous ou vérifiez l'orthographe.",
"noLocalResults": "Aucun service de Kingston ne correspond à cette recherche. Essayez les services provinciaux ou utilisez des mots-clés différents.",
"placeholder": "Chercher nourriture, logement, soutien en crise, services de santé...",
"searchHint": "Essayez: banque alimentaire, santé mentale, logement, aide juridique"
```
