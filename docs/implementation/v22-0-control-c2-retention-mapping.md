# v22.0 Control C2 Privacy Retention Mapping

Control reference:

1. [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md)

## Control Objective

Map all candidate integration payload fields to explicit retention limits and data minimization rules, ensuring no conflict with privacy-first constraints.

## Retention Mapping (Current State)

| Payload Field                                                            | Data Class                   | Required for Function | Retention Window    | Storage Location                          | Deletion Mechanism | Notes                                           |

| `decision`                                                               | governance decision enum     | yes                   | pending policy lock | `pilot_integration_feasibility_decisions` | pending            | enum-only field; no raw user text               |
| `decision_date`                                                          | governance metadata          | yes                   | pending policy lock | `pilot_integration_feasibility_decisions` | pending            | required for audit trail                        |

| `violations[]`                                                           | policy outcome codes         | yes                   | pending policy lock | `pilot_integration_feasibility_decisions` | pending            | code list only, no free-form user data required |

| `owners[]`                                                               | internal ownership labels    | yes                   | pending policy lock | `pilot_integration_feasibility_decisions` | pending            | role/owner labels only                          |
| Disallowed keys (`query`, `query_text`, `message`, `user_text`, `notes`) | prohibited                   | no                    | n/a                 | rejected at validation layer              | n/a                | enforced by privacy guard schemas               |

## Data Minimization Basis

1. Integration and pilot schemas restrict payloads to enumerated codes and governance metadata.
2. Disallowed privacy keys are blocked by validation in `lib/schemas/privacy-guards.ts`.
3. No external integration endpoint is active; only internal pilot feasibility recording endpoint exists.

## Policy Lock Checklist (For Closure)

All items are required to mark C2 `complete`:

- [ ] Retention duration is defined for each allowed field in the retention mapping table.
- [ ] Deletion trigger is defined for each allowed field (`time-based`, `decision-superseded`, or both).
- [ ] Deletion executor is defined (job/manual owner) for each allowed field.
- [ ] Verification evidence is attached (read-only query output or audit proof confirming deletion path behavior).
- [ ] Privacy sign-off memo is attached with reviewer name and date.
- [ ] Updates are synchronized in [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md).

Acceptance criteria:

1. C2-2, C2-3, and C2-5 are all checked complete.
2. No field in the retention mapping table remains `pending policy lock`.
3. Evidence table contains dated links and status `complete`.

## Required Checks

- [x] C2-1: No prohibited personal identifiers in integration payload.
- [ ] C2-2: Retention windows are explicitly defined per field.
- [ ] C2-3: Deletion path is defined and testable.
- [x] C2-4: Data minimization rationale documented.
- [ ] C2-5: Privacy review sign-off captured.

## Decision

- Result: `pending`
- Conflicts identified: `Retention windows and deletion mechanism are not yet policy-locked for candidate external integration payloads.`
- Escalation needed: `Define and approve field-level retention windows and deletion procedure by 2026-03-21.`

## Verification Note

Completion requires updating C2 status in [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md).
