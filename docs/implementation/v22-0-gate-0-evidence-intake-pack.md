# v22.0 Gate 0 Evidence Intake Pack

This document defines the minimum evidence package needed to close user-owned Gate 0 blockers.

Use with:

4. [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md)

Rules:

1. Do not mark any blocker `complete` unless all minimum evidence checks pass.
2. Evidence must be dated and attributable (owner/reviewer).
3. No fabricated evidence or inferred closure is allowed.
