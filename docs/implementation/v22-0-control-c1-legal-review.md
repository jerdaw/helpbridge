# v22.0 Control C1 Legal Review (Telemetry and Re-Identification Clauses)

Control reference:

1. [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md)

## Control Objective

Reject any external integration terms that require either:

1. re-identification capability, or
2. prohibited telemetry transfer that violates v22 redlines.

## Scope

1. Candidate partner contracts and API terms.
2. Addenda related to analytics, retention, and audit obligations.
3. Any data-processing clauses linked to 211 pathway integration.

Current review mode (2026-03-09):

1. Repo-evidence legal readiness review is complete.
2. Candidate external partner contract artifacts are not yet attached in-repo.
3. C1 cannot be fully closed until candidate terms are reviewed clause-by-clause.

## Required Clause Checks

- [x] C1-1: No raw user query text transfer requirement.
- [x] C1-2: No forced user-identifying telemetry transfer requirement.
- [ ] C1-3: No re-identification capability requirement.
- [x] C1-4: No conflict with privacy-first constraints in governance standards.

## Evidence Snapshot

1. Governance redline baseline:
   - [Governance Protocol: The Kingston 150 Standard](../governance/standards.md)
2. Privacy and instrumentation controls:
   - [ADR-020: v22 Phase 0 Pilot Instrumentation and Privacy Guardrails](../adr/020-v22-pilot-phase0-instrumentation-and-privacy-guardrails.md)
   - [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md)
3. Comparative/legal-risk context package:
   - [KCC vs 211 Objective Evaluation (2026-02-27)](../evaluation/KCC_vs_211_Objective_Evaluation_2026-02-27.md)

## Evidence Intake Checklist (For Closure)

All items are required to mark C1 `complete`:

- [ ] Intake artifact `C1-partner-terms-bundle` attached (contract/API terms/addenda used for review).
- [ ] Clause-by-clause redline notes recorded for C1-1, C1-2, C1-3, and C1-4.
- [ ] Any conflicting clause is explicitly marked `reject` with rationale and fallback path.
- [ ] Final legal recommendation recorded as one of: `acceptable`, `acceptable_with_conditions`, `not_acceptable`.
- [ ] Evidence links added to this document and [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md).

Acceptance criteria:

1. No unresolved clause remains for C1-3 (re-identification capability).
2. Evidence table contains dated artifact links, reviewer, and status `complete`.
3. C1 status is synchronized in the Gate 0 checklist/evidence tracker.

## Evidence Table

| Artifact                    | Location                                   | Reviewer | Date       | Status                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Legal readiness memo        | this document                              | jer      | 2026-03-09 | complete (repo evidence) |
| Clause diff / redline notes | candidate partner terms (not yet attached) | jer      | pending    | pending                  |
| Final legal recommendation  | pending legal review package               | jer      | pending    | pending                  |

## Decision

- Result: `pending`
- Blocking findings: `Candidate partner terms are not yet attached for clause-level legal review (C1-3 unresolved).`
- Escalation needed: `Obtain candidate partner legal/API terms and run clause-level redline review by 2026-03-21.`

## Verification Note

Completion requires updating C1 status in [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md).
