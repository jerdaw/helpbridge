## Gate 0 Exit Decision

- Current decision: **NO-GO**
- Decision date: **2026-03-09**

Open blockers:

1. C1 legal clause review is incomplete because candidate partner terms are not yet attached.
2. C2 retention policy lock is incomplete (field-level retention windows and deletion procedure not approved).
3. D4 operational readiness remains incomplete (named pilot partner list and outreach owner execution evidence pending).
4. Baseline metrics are structurally complete but signal quality is currently low (`M1` and `M3` are `NULL` due to zero denominator in baseline window).

## Owner Notes

1. No evidence values are fabricated.
2. External integration activation remains blocked until C1/C2/C3 are completed.
3. This tracker is updated whenever any linked artifact status changes.
4. User-owned blocker tracking follows gate-event updates only.
