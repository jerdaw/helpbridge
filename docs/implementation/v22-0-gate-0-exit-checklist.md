# v22.0 Gate 0 Exit Checklist (Decision Control)

This is the hard control used to determine whether Gate 0 can exit.

Rule:

1. Gate 0 exit is `GO` only if all required checks are `pass`.
2. Any `fail` or `pending` check keeps Gate 0 at `NO-GO`.
3. Step 1 approval lock (`D1-D7`) is necessary but not sufficient for Gate 0 exit.
