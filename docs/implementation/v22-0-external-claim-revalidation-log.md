# v22.0 External-Claim Re-Validation Log

This log tracks re-validation of external-agent-derived claims before they can influence gate decisions.

Rule:

1. No external claim may be treated as confirmed without primary-source and local-evidence review.

Source plan:

1. [v22.0 Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan](../planning/v22-0-non-duplicate-value-decision-plan.md)

## Validation Checklist Per Claim

For each claim marked `validated`:

1. Primary source citation captured.
2. Local code/docs evidence linked.
3. Contradictions or limits documented.
4. Decision impact explicitly stated.

## Decision Impact Log

| Date       | Claim ID | Validation Outcome | Impacted Decision(s)                                  | Reviewer |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |

| 2026-03-09 | E2       | validated          | D6 (redlines), C1/C2 control priority                 | jer      |
| 2026-03-09 | E3       | validated          | H7 risk handling, threat-model mitigation tracking    | jer      |
| 2026-03-09 | E4       | rejected           | verification cadence wording and governance messaging | jer      |
| 2026-03-09 | E5       | validated          | H8 kept as pilot hypothesis with evidence gate        | jer      |

## Outcome Summary

1. 3/5 claims validated (`E2`, `E3`, `E5`).
2. 2/5 claims rejected (`E1`, `E4`) due over-broad/default assumptions not supported for Gate 0 decisions.
3. No rejected claim is used as gate-deciding evidence.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] All claims reviewed
- [x] No `pending` claim used as gate-deciding evidence
- [x] Rejected claims documented with rationale
- [x] Summary included in Gate 0 evidence package
