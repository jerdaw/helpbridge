# v22.0 External-Claim Re-Validation Log

This log tracks re-validation of external-agent-derived claims before they can influence gate decisions.

Rule:

1. No external claim may be treated as confirmed without primary-source and local-evidence review.

Source plan:

1. [v22.0 Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan](../planning/v22-0-non-duplicate-value-decision-plan.md)
