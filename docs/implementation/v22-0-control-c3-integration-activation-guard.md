# v22.0 Control C3 Integration Activation Guard

Control reference:

1. [v22.0 Integration Feasibility Decision Record](v22-0-integration-feasibility-decision.md)
2. [Production Deployment Checklist](../deployment/production-checklist.md)

## Control Objective

Prevent activation of any external integration pathway until C1 and C2 are completed and verified.

## Operational Guard

1. Treat integration activation as **release-gated**.
2. Block deployment/activation when either C1 or C2 is incomplete.
3. Record explicit GO/NO-GO decision in Gate 0 evidence package.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] C3-1: Activation guard documented as release-gated.
- [x] C3-2: Production deployment checklist includes explicit C1/C2/C3 gate checks.
- [x] C3-3: No external integration API activation path is present in current codebase.
- [x] C3-4: Integration decision and approval checklist reference guard artifacts.
