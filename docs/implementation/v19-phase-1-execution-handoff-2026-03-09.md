This handoff isolates the remaining v19 execution tasks that should run after v22 Gate 0 prerequisites are satisfied.

3. [v22.0 Approval Checklist](../planning/v22-0-approval-checklist.md)

5. [E2E Automation Baseline (2026-03-12)](../testing/e2e-skip-baseline-2026-03-09.md)

## Start Conditions

1. Step 1 v22 approvals are locked.
2. No unresolved redline conflicts for current conditional integration mode.
3. Baseline report is populated for M1/M3 (both `NULL` from zero baseline-window events) with execution metadata recorded.
4. `robots.txt` is already implemented via `app/robots.ts`; remaining blockers are execution-focused (QA + E2E + data review).

## Remaining v19 Phase 1 Tasks

1. Production environment audit (required).
2. Critical user journey testing (6 scenarios, required).
3. Top-20 service data quality final review (required).
4. Keep the default E2E suite skip-free and run the dedicated opt-in browser suites when their environments are available.

## Suggested Execution Order

1. Run environment validation and QA scripts:
   - `npm run validate:env`
   - `npm run qa:prelaunch`
2. Execute manual critical user journeys and record pass/fail evidence.
3. Execute top-20 data quality review checklist and record findings.
4. Run the dedicated optional browser suites when feasible:
   - `npm run test:e2e:prod-local`
   - `npm run test:e2e:server-local`
5. Update roadmap/v19 docs with actual completion state.

## Evidence Artifacts to Produce

1. Phase 1 QA run log with timestamp and operator.
2. User-journey test report (6 scenarios with outcomes).
3. Top-20 data quality review sheet with fixes or accepted risks.
4. E2E automation baseline record showing zero inline default-suite skips plus any opt-in suite outcomes.
5. Updated roadmap blocker checklist showing closure status.
