# v17.6: PWA Enhancement

> **Status**: Code implementation complete. Remaining manual verification work is tracked in `docs/planning/roadmap.md` under v17.6.

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks (single developer)
**Dependencies:** v17.4 (i18n for offline locale), v17.5 (accessibility)
**Impact:** Improved app store discoverability, offline functionality, multi-language offline
**Implementation Period:** 2026-01-17 to 2026-01-23

## Executive Summary

Enhance Progressive Web App capabilities for better mobile experience and app store compatibility.

**Architecture reality (already implemented):**

- PWA is built with `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` (see `next.config.ts`).
- Offline fallback route exists at `app/[locale]/offline/page.tsx` and is referenced by Workbox fallback logic.
- Offline data + feedback syncing already runs client-side via `components/offline/OfflineSync.tsx`.
- Manual verification steps already exist in `docs/runbooks/pwa-testing.md` and `docs/development/mobile-ready.md`.

**Code-deliverables (implemented):**

- `public/manifest.json` uses store-quality icon + screenshot paths (no `/icon?w=...`).
- `public/custom-sw.js` uses real `icon` + `badge` assets under `public/icons/`.
- Icon set + screenshots exist under `public/icons/` and `public/screenshots/` (unit tests enforce dimensions).

## Remaining Work (Manual / External)

These items can’t be “implemented” purely in repo code (they require production builds, real devices, external tooling, and/or credentials). This is the wrap-up checklist for v17.6.

**Release verification (required to mark v17.6 complete):**

- [ ] Replace placeholder screenshots with real captures (keep exact dimensions): `public/screenshots/*`
- [ ] Verify icons are “store-quality” (branding consistency + maskable safe area): `public/icons/*`
- [ ] Validate the web manifest (e.g. webmanifest.app) and confirm installability
- [ ] Run Lighthouse PWA audit on a production build and hit score targets
- [ ] Validate install UX on real devices (Android Chrome, iOS Safari)
- [ ] Validate offline mode for all 7 locales, including Arabic RTL
- [ ] Validate offline → online restore behavior: data refresh + queued feedback sync
- [ ] Confirm service worker registration + `importScripts` (no 404s) in production build

**Store listing (optional / out of scope for code-only work):**

- [ ] If pursuing Play Store listing: Bubblewrap/TWA build + signing + console submission (see `docs/development/mobile-ready.md`)
- [ ] If pursuing iOS App Store: native wrapper + Apple Developer credentials (see `docs/development/mobile-ready.md`)

**Ongoing monitoring (privacy-preserving):**

- [ ] Follow `docs/runbooks/pwa-testing.md` on each release; watch DevTools for SW registration/import errors
- [ ] Consider a release-time Lighthouse report artifact (no user tracking)

> [!NOTE]
> **Manifest JSON** must be valid JSON (no comments). Keep explanations in Markdown, not inline.

## Implementation Status (Snapshot: 2026-01-23)

Completed in code:

- Manifest metadata, shortcuts, and share target (`public/manifest.json`).
- Store icon set + screenshots exist in `public/icons/` and `public/screenshots/` (tests enforce required sizes).
- Share target endpoint (`app/api/v1/share/route.ts`).
- Offline navigation fallback resolves (`/offline` rewrites to `/{locale}/offline` via middleware).
- URL → state hydration (`app/[locale]/page.tsx` reads `?q`, `?category`, `?openNow`).
- Workbox caching rules updated in `next.config.ts` (offline fallback, static assets, export endpoint).
- Privacy-preserving monitoring (`GET /api/health` includes PWA checks).

Automated coverage (non-exhaustive):

- PWA manifest assets + SW icon paths: `tests/unit/pwa/manifest-assets.test.ts`
- Share Target redirect behavior: `tests/api/v1/share.test.ts`
- Health endpoint includes PWA checks: `tests/api/health.test.ts`
- `/offline` locale resolution + RTL + basic offline search: `tests/e2e/offline.spec.ts`
- URL hydration (`?q`, `?category`, `?openNow`): `tests/e2e/pwa-launch-hydration.spec.ts`
- Offline feedback queue + sync logic: `tests/lib/offline/feedback.test.ts`

Remaining manual verification: see **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above.

## Phase 1: PWA Manifest Enhancements (1-2 days)

### 1.1 Current Manifest Analysis

**File:** `public/manifest.json`

**Current state:**

```json
{
  "name": "Kingston Care Connect",
  "short_name": "KCC",
  "description": "Find community services in Kingston. Free, confidential, and instant.",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#2563eb",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icon?w=192", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "/icon?w=512", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
  ],
  "screenshots": []
}
```

### 1.2 Enhance Manifest with Metadata

**Modify:** `public/manifest.json`

```json
{
  "name": "Kingston Care Connect - Social Services Search",
  "short_name": "KCC",
  "description": "Find essential community services in Kingston. Free, confidential, and instant. Health, housing, crisis, financial, and more.",
  "start_url": "/",

      "label": "Search for services on mobile"
    },
    {
      "src": "/screenshots/mobile-detail.png",
      "sizes": "540x720",
      "type": "image/png",
      "form_factor": "narrow",

      "sizes": "180x180",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-maskable-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable"
    },

  ],
  "share_target": {
    "action": "/api/v1/share",
    "method": "POST",
    "enctype": "multipart/form-data",
    "params": {
      "title": "title",
      "text": "text",
      "url": "url"
    }
  },
  "prefer_related_applications": false,
  "related_applications": [],

      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/shortcut-search-96.png",
          "sizes": "96x96",
          "type": "image/png"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Crisis Resources",
      "short_name": "Crisis",
      "description": "Find crisis support immediately",
      "url": "/?category=Crisis",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/shortcut-crisis-96.png",
          "sizes": "96x96",
          "type": "image/png"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "My Dashboard",
      "short_name": "Dashboard",
      "description": "View your saved services",
      "url": "/dashboard",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/shortcut-dashboard-96.png",
          "sizes": "96x96",
          "type": "image/png"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- `start_url` stays `/` so `next-intl` middleware can select the correct locale prefix based on user preference.
- `shortcuts` and `share_target` require URL → state hydration on the home page (see Phase 3).
  - For offline support, `/offline` is a stable navigation fallback URL; middleware rewrites it to `/{locale}/offline`.

### 1.3 Create PWA Screenshots

Existing files (dimension-validated by tests):

- `public/screenshots/mobile-search.png` (540×720)
- `public/screenshots/mobile-detail.png` (540×720)
- `public/screenshots/tablet-search.png` (1280×720)

### 1.4 Create Icon Set

Implemented in `public/icons/` (dimension-validated by tests). Design/branding verification is tracked in **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above.

### 1.5 Implement Share Target Handler

**New file:** `app/api/v1/share/route.ts`

The `share_target` in manifest.json requires a server endpoint to handle shared content:

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const formData = await request.formData()

    const title = formData.get("title") as string | null
    const text = formData.get("text") as string | null
    const url = formData.get("url") as string | null

    // Redirect to search with shared content as query
    const searchQuery = text || title || url || ""

    // Redirect to Home with the shared content.
    // NOTE: Use 303 so the follow-up request is a GET.
    // Locale selection is handled by next-intl middleware on the redirected request.
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/?q=${encodeURIComponent(searchQuery)}`, request.url), 303)
  } catch (error) {
    // On error, redirect to home
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", request.url), 303)
  }
}
```

**Use case:** User shares text from another app → KCC opens with that text as search query.

### 1.6 Update HTML Meta Tags

**Modify:** `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

```typescript
import { Metadata } from "next"

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  manifest: "/manifest.json",
  appleWebApp: {
    capable: true,
    statusBarStyle: "default",
    title: "KCC",
  },
  formatDetection: {
    telephone: false,
  },
  icons: {
    icon: [
      { url: "/icons/favicon-16.png", sizes: "16x16" },
      { url: "/icons/favicon-32.png", sizes: "32x32" },
    ],
    apple: [{ url: "/icons/apple-touch-icon.png", sizes: "180x180" }],
  },
}
```

## Phase 2: Service Worker Enhancement (2 days)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Architecture Decision:** This project uses `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` which auto-generates service workers. Custom service worker logic must go in `public/custom-sw.js`; Workbox configuration goes in `next.config.ts`. **Do not modify auto-generated files.**

### 2.1 Current Service Worker

**File:** `public/custom-sw.js`

**Current capabilities:**

- Push notification handling only
- ~40 lines

### 2.2 Enhance Service Worker

**Modify:** `public/custom-sw.js`

```javascript
self.addEventListener("push", function (event) {
  if (!event.data) return

  const data = event.data.json()
  const options = {
    body: data.body,
    icon: data.icon || "/icons/icon-192.png",
    badge: "/icons/badge-72x72.png",
    vibrate: [100, 50, 100],
    data: {
      url: data.url || "/",
    },
    actions: data.actions || [
      { action: "explore", title: "View Details" },
      { action: "close", title: "Close" },
    ],
  }

  event.waitUntil(self.registration.showNotification(data.title, options))
})

self.addEventListener("notificationclick", function (event) {
  event.notification.close()

  if (event.action === "close") return

  event.waitUntil(
    clients.matchAll({ type: "window", includeUncontrolled: true }).then(function (clientList) {
      const url = event.notification.data?.url || "/"
      for (const client of clientList) {
        if (client.url === url && "focus" in client) return client.focus()
      }
      if (clients.openWindow) return clients.openWindow(url)
    })
  )
})
```

Notes:

- Avoid adding `fetch` handlers inside `custom-sw.js`; Workbox (via `next-pwa`) already handles offline routing via `fallbacks.document` and runtime caching in `next.config.ts`.
- Feedback/background sync already runs at the app layer (see `components/offline/OfflineSync.tsx`). Service Worker Background Sync is optional and should only be added if we need “sync without opening the app”.
- For multi-lingual UX, prefer sending localized `actions` from the push payload; the service worker should not hardcode UI strings per-locale.

### 2.3 Offline Page Route Handler

**Ensure:** `app/[locale]/offline/page.tsx` exists and renders correctly

Implemented and covered by automation for locale + RTL (`tests/e2e/offline.spec.ts`). Offline network behavior is verified via runbook and tracked in **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above.

---

## Phase 3: URL Hydration (Shortcuts + Share Target) (1 day)

The manifest `shortcuts` and `share_target` will only be useful if the Home page can hydrate initial state from the URL.

### 3.1 Home Page: Read URL Params → Search State

**Modify:** `app/[locale]/page.tsx` (or `hooks/useSearch.ts`)
Implemented (covered by `tests/e2e/pwa-launch-hydration.spec.ts`).

### 3.2 Share Target: Redirect to URL Params

**Add:** `app/api/v1/share/route.ts`
Implemented (covered by `tests/api/v1/share.test.ts`).

> [!NOTE]
> **Background Sync**: feedback + offline sync already auto-runs when the app is open and the network returns (see `components/offline/OfflineSync.tsx`). Service Worker Background Sync is a stretch goal and should only be added if we need syncing while the app is closed.

---

## Phase 4: PWA Caching Strategy (1 day)

### 4.1 Analyze Workbox Configuration

**File:** `next.config.ts`

**Current architecture notes:**

- `fallbacks.document` is set to `/offline` (Workbox navigation fallback).
- `workboxOptions.importScripts` loads `public/custom-sw.js`.
- `workboxOptions.runtimeCaching` exists, but the URL patterns should be reviewed to ensure they match the real API routes (`/api/v1/...`).

### 4.2 Verify Cache Strategies

> [!NOTE]
> **Custom cache strategies:** Modify `next.config.ts` Workbox configuration, NOT the generated service worker files.

Implemented in `next.config.ts` (manual release verification is tracked in **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above).

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Verification (1 day)

Manual verification lives in `docs/runbooks/pwa-testing.md` (authoritative) and is tracked in **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above.

---

## Phase 6: App Store Readiness (1 day)

### 6.1 Google Play Store PWA Listing

If planning mobile app store listing:

This is external tooling + credentials work (see `docs/development/mobile-ready.md`). Full native store submission is tracked under v15.1 (paused) in `docs/planning/roadmap.md`.

### 6.2 App Store (iOS) PWA Listing

For iOS:

Store listing requires native wrapper + Apple credentials; see `docs/development/mobile-ready.md`.

**Note:** iOS doesn't install PWAs to home screen automatically; users must use "Add to Home Screen" menu.

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Monitoring (1 day)

### 7.1 PWA Implementation Guide

Update existing docs instead of creating new:

Implemented (docs reflect current PWA config).

### 7.2 Monitoring PWA Health

**Monitoring constraints:** Maintain privacy-by-design (no user tracking for installs/usage).

Practical, privacy-preserving checks:

Tracked in **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above.

---

## Success Criteria

**Code (implemented):**

- [x] All icon sizes generated
- [x] Tests verify key PWA/offline behaviors (manifest assets, offline route, URL hydration, offline feedback queue)
- [x] Basic E2E coverage for offline search after initial sync (app-layer offline, not SW)

**Manual / external (release verification):**

Tracked in **Remaining Work (Manual / External)** above.

**Future automation (optional):**

- [ ] Add release-verification E2E coverage for service worker caching + installability (requires production build + PWA enabled)

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- **Workbox** (via next-pwa): Already configured
- **Service Worker API**: Supported in all modern browsers
- **IndexedDB**: For offline storage (already implemented)
- **Background Sync API**: Optional (only needed if syncing while app is closed becomes a requirement)

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. Check manifest validity weekly
2. Monitor Lighthouse scores during release verification
3. Review sync success via logs/runbook (no user tracking)
4. Watch for service worker registration/import errors during QA

---

## Future Enhancements (v17.7+)

- [ ] Native app wrapper (Capacitor)
- [ ] App Store listing (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Push notification campaigns
- [ ] Advanced offline analytics
- [ ] Periodic background refresh
