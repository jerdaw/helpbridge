# v22.0 Approval Checklist (Step 1 Sign-Off)

This is the canonical decision record for v22.0 Step 1 approvals.

Use this file to:

1. Lock approvals before Phase 0 starts.
2. Record decision ownership and dates.
3. Determine Gate 0 readiness with an explicit go/no-go outcome.

## Approval Records

Instructions:

1. Set `selected_choice` to an explicit value.
2. Set `decision_status` to `locked` only after owner sign-off.
3. Populate `date` with ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
4. Keep `blocked_if_unset` as `true` for all records.

Decision rule:

1. If all three criteria are `GO`, Phase 0 may begin.
2. If any criterion is `NO-GO`, Phase 0 remains blocked.

Current outcome: **GO (Step 1 sign-off complete; conditional integration controls documented).**

> [!WARNING]
> **Step 1 `GO` is not Gate 0 exit approval.**
> Gate 0 exit status is currently **NO-GO** until C1/C2 control closure and remaining operational readiness blockers are resolved in the Gate 0 evidence tracker.

## Technical Prerequisites Completed (2026-03-09)

- [x] Pilot Phase 0 schema migration applied and verified in Supabase.
- [x] Pilot RLS policy coverage verified (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on all 4 pilot tables).
- [x] Legacy `user_metadata` function references removed from public functions (`user_metadata_function_count = 0`).
- [x] Internal pilot routes and validation/test coverage implemented.
