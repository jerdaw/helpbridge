## 🎯 Active Work

### v22.0: Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan 🔄 ACTIVE

**Status**: DRAFT COMPLETE — User Approval Gate Pending (no implementation started)
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Strategic Non-Duplication with 211)
**Total Effort**: 90-day decision cycle (~13 weeks)
**Timeline**: Phase 0 (2 weeks) + Phase 1 (8 weeks) + Phase 2 decision cycle
**Dependencies**: v22 objective evaluation artifacts + integration feasibility decision
**Created**: 2026-02-27

Reposition KCC from potential directory duplication to measurable last-mile outcome value (connection success, reliability, referral completion), with explicit kill criteria if value is not demonstrated.

**👉 Detailed Plan: [v22.0 Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan](v22-0-non-duplicate-value-decision-plan.md)**

#### Gate-Oriented Objectives

1. Prove non-duplicate value vs 211 on measurable connection outcomes.
2. Validate privacy-safe integration feasibility with 211 data pathways.
3. Keep strict stop conditions for initiatives that do not outperform baseline.

#### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 0)

1. Confirm v22 objective function and hard constraints.
2. Lock pilot scope (default: housing intake) and pilot partners.
3. Complete baseline instrumentation (failed contact, time-to-connection, referral completion).
4. Record integration feasibility decision (`go`, `conditional`, `blocked`) against privacy redlines.
5. Complete offline/local data threat model and evidence re-validation log.

#### Gate 1 Thresholds (Pilot Cycle 1)

- Failed contact attempts reduced by at least 30% vs baseline.
- Time-to-successful-connection reduced by at least 25%.
- Freshness SLA compliance at least 70%.
- Referral outcome capture at least 50%.
- Fatal data-decay error rate at or below 10%.

### v21.0: Admissions Portfolio & Production Launch (PAUSED)

**Status**: PAUSED — Revisit after v22.0 Gate 1 decision
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Admissions Impact)
**Total Effort**: ~85–120 hours (mix of autonomous + human-required work)
**Timeline**: 12 weeks (4 phases)
**Dependencies**: v19.0 documentation complete ✅
**Created**: 2026-02-25

Transform the project from "impressive prototype" to "deployed, validated, evidence-backed community tool" with real-world impact metrics and professional portfolio artifacts.

**Context**: Developed through a structured three-pass analysis (comprehensive scan → devil's advocate → steelman → objective synthesis) to maximize medical school application value while ensuring all recommendations are defensible and achievable.

**👉 Detailed Plan: [v21.0 Admissions Portfolio Plan](v21-admissions-portfolio-plan.md)**

#### Strategic Insight

The project has exceptional documentation, governance design, and technical infrastructure. The credibility gap is entirely in **execution** — no deployment, no users, no named partners, no verified services at L3. Every item prioritizes execution of existing systems over building new ones.

#### Phase Summary

| Phase       | When       | Effort | Theme                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0** | Today      | <2h    | Immediate housekeeping (name on project, EDIA fix, git tags, ABS gap analysis)                                                               |
| **Phase 1** | Week 1     | 15–20h | Pre-deployment critical path (crisis test protocol, crisis-path component tests, geocoding, deploy, demo video)                              |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 2–4  | 25–35h | Governance execution (first verification cycle, L3 outreach, French translations, impact page, project brief)                                |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 4–8  | 20–30h | External validation (advisory board, professional feedback sessions, community meeting, accessibility audit, published compliance summaries) |
| **Phase 4** | Weeks 8–12 | 25–35h | Evidence portfolio (partner endorsement, service gap analysis, volunteer pilot, grant application, final ABS)                                |

#### Key Design Decisions

- **Crisis test protocol is a deployment blocker** — the most ethically significant feature must be verified before going live
- **Impact page framed around governance metrics, not usage** — low early traffic would backfire; data quality metrics are compelling on day 1
- **User testing reframed as professional consultations** — front-line social workers (not students), framed as consultation (not research) to avoid ethics review requirements
- **French translations require native speaker review** — AI-translated crisis access scripts for vulnerable populations create liability without quality review
- **Partner endorsement at Week 8+** — must deploy, achieve L3s, and build relationships first
- **Component testing scoped to crisis path** — safety-driven engineering decision, not a coverage percentage target

#### Success Criteria

**Production Evidence:**

- [ ] Live production URL with custom domain
- [ ] Crisis detection formally tested (20 scenarios documented)
- [ ] ≥85% geocoding coverage (up from 70%)
- [ ] Public status page operational

**Governance Evidence:**

- [ ] First verification cycle completed and documented
- [ ] ≥5 services at L3 verification (up from 0)
- [ ] French advanced fields completed with native speaker review
- [ ] Identity tag pass documented (with negative findings where applicable)

**External Validation:**

- [ ] Professional feedback sessions documented (n≥3)
- [ ] ≥1 community engagement meeting documented
- [ ] ≥1 partner endorsement letter on file

**Portfolio Artifacts:**

- [ ] ABS-ready STAR narrative (150 words), fully substantiable
- [ ] 1-page project brief for professional referrers
- [ ] 2-minute demo video
- [ ] Impact page live (governance/data-quality framed)
- [ ] PIA and AI compliance summaries published
- [ ] Structural service gap analysis written and shared

### v22.1: Post-Launch Search Quality & UX Improvements (Deferred Candidate)

**Priority**: HIGH (After Beta Launch)
**Effort**: ~15-20 hours
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks post-launch

Improve search quality and user experience based on real-world usage patterns from beta testing.

**Note**: Deferred until v22.0 stage gates pass and launch path is re-confirmed.

#### Goals

1. **Search Quality Monitoring**: Understand when searches fail and why
2. **Expanded Search Vocabulary**: Cover practical crisis terminology users actually use
3. **Geographic Transparency**: Show users when results are incomplete due to missing location data
4. **Partner Feedback Loop**: Automatically alert partners when services need attention

#### Implementation Tasks

- **Task 1** (4-6h): Zero-Results Tracking & Admin Dashboard
  - Wire `zero-results.ts` pattern hashing into analytics table
  - Create admin view: "Top 10 failed query patterns this week" (hashed)
  - Weekly digest email with actionable search quality insights
  - Dashboard widgets: services with <50% helpfulness, categories with high "not found" feedback

- **Task 2** (2-3h): Synonym Dictionary Expansion
  - Add ~90 practical terms based on real zero-results data
  - **Utilities**: "hydro", "bill help", "water bill", "phone bill", "internet"
  - **Documents**: "birth certificate", "ID", "OHIP card", "SIN", "passport"
  - **Childcare**: "daycare", "babysitting", "childcare subsidy", "baby"
  - **Seniors**: "nursing home", "home care", "meals on wheels", "assisted living"
  - **Transportation**: "bus pass", "ride", "accessible transit", "mobility"
  - **Addiction**: "rehab", "aa", "na", "sober", "detox"
  - **Education**: "ged", "literacy", "esl", "tutoring"
  - **Youth**: "runaway", "foster care", "emancipation"

- **Task 3** (2h): Geographic Search Transparency UI
  - Badge in results: "Showing X nearby + Y more without location data"
  - Show services without coordinates at bottom of "near me" results
  - Add "Location unavailable" note instead of silent exclusion

- **Task 4** (3-4h): Feedback Auto-Alerting for Partners
  - Auto-tag feedback by type (data quality vs. user confusion)
  - Email partner when service gets >3 issue reports in 7 days
  - Admin dashboard: "Top 5 services needing attention" widget

#### Success Criteria

- Zero-results tracking captures 100% of failed searches (hashed for privacy)
- Synonym coverage increases from ~30 to ~150 entries
- Geographic filter shows result completeness to users
- Partners receive automated alerts within 24h of threshold breach
- Search quality dashboard shows actionable insights weekly

---

### v23.0: Community Engagement & Content Expansion (Planned)

**Priority**: MEDIUM (Post-Launch, User-Driven)
**Effort**: ~8-10 hours initial setup, ongoing moderation
**Timeline**: 3-6 months post-launch

Enable community-driven service suggestions with moderation workflow.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Public service submission form (authenticated or anonymous with verification)
- [ ] Moderation queue for admin review
- [ ] Auto-suggest services based on "not found" feedback patterns
- [ ] Partner notification when community suggests updates to their services

---

### Observability & Performance (Post-v18.0)

- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard (visualize circuit breaker state, p50/p95/p99 graphs over time)
- Automated load testing in CI (scheduled weekly k6 runs with automatic baseline comparison)
- Performance regression alerts on pull requests (fail builds if latency degrades >20%)
- Lighthouse CI budget checks for bundle size and Core Web Vitals

### Advanced Resilience (Deprioritized)

The following items are over-engineering for current scale and are **not recommended** unless specific production issues emerge:

- ~~Enhanced circuit breaker features (per-operation, dynamic thresholds, predictive)~~ - Current static config works well
- ~~Multi-region resilience (database replica failover)~~ - Single-region Supabase is sufficient for Kingston
- ~~Cached authorization with Redis~~ - In-memory approach is fine at current scale

### API & Integration (Partner-Driven)

The following items should only be pursued if partners express specific needs:

- GraphQL API - **Skip unless requested** (REST is sufficient for current use cases)
- Webhooks - **Wait for partner demand** (no active integrations yet)
- API keys & server-to-server auth - **Wait for third-party integration requests**
- Public API documentation - **Consider** (OpenAPI spec exists at `docs/api/openapi.yaml`, needs publishing)

### Data & Content

- ✅ **Automated data staleness detection** - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (monthly GitHub Action workflow)
- **Community-driven service suggestions** - See v23.0 planned work above
- **Multi-language support expansion** - Add Korean, Ukrainian based on demographic needs (data-driven decision)
- ~~Enhanced search: Fuzzy matching, typo tolerance~~ - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Levenshtein distance, max 2 edits)
- **Voice search improvements** - Consider if user feedback indicates demand
