# HelpBridge: Product Roadmap

> **Current Version**: v22.0 (Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan, Phase 0)
> **Next Milestone**: v22.0 Gate 0 Exit (C1/C2/D4 blocker closure)
> **Last Updated**: 2026-03-12
> **Platform Status**: Strategic Repositioning — v22.0 Decision-Gated Planning

## 📊 Current State

- **Services**: 196 manually curated social services (verified 2026-02-11)
- **Tests**: 1080 passing, 24 skipped (latest full local run)
  - Coverage metrics need a fresh `npm run test:coverage` snapshot before publishing new percentages
  - Remaining testing backlog centers on component smoke coverage, unhappy-path coverage, feedback/update integrations, and E2E stabilization
  - 7 E2E tests skipped in `tests/e2e/**` (documented baseline: [E2E Skip Baseline (2026-03-09)](../testing/e2e-skip-baseline-2026-03-09.md))
  - CI budget mode: Playwright runs on `workflow_dispatch` or `main` commits containing `[run-e2e]`
  - Recent: full local suite green at 1080/1104 tests
- **Load Testing**: k6 infrastructure and baseline documentation are in place; follow-up work is comparative analysis and ongoing refresh
- **Resilience**: 100% circuit breaker protection on all API routes and database operations
- **Security**: Dependency hygiene automation is in place (Dependabot, CI validation, header checks); deeper scanning remains on the backlog
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (automated testing via Axe-core)
- **Languages**: 7 locales (EN, FR, ZH-Hans, AR, PT, ES, PA)
  - All 7 locale files are at key parity (964/964 keys each)
  - Advanced French service-data fields remain incomplete (`access_script_fr`, `hours_text_fr`, `eligibility_notes_fr`, `synthetic_queries_fr`)
- **Offline-Ready**: PWA with IndexedDB fallback and background sync
- **Push Notifications**: Optional only; UI and SDK remain disabled unless OneSignal is explicitly configured
- **Observability**: Production monitoring (Axiom), automated alerting (Slack, 6 alert types), SLO monitoring (PROVISIONAL targets), 5 operational runbooks, deployment procedures, incident response plan
- **Data Quality**:
  - Coordinates: 70.4% (58/196 missing — impacts geolocation)
  - Email: 17.9% (161/196 missing — contact channel gap)
  - Identity Tags: 44.4% (109/196 missing — personalization limited)
  - French Synthetic Queries: 36.2% (125/196 missing — semantic search gap)
- **Deployment Status**: Live on the direct-VPS path at `https://helpbridge.ca`; Docker deploys now prefer `buildx`, `/api/v1/health` reports the deployed revision, and public boot degrades safely when optional browser integrations are unset

## 🎯 Active Work

### v22.0: Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan 🔄 ACTIVE

**Status**: PHASE 0 IN PROGRESS — **Gate 0 Exit NO-GO** (Step 1 sign-off locked; real-world blockers remain)
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Strategic Non-Duplication with 211)
**Total Effort**: 90-day decision cycle (~13 weeks)
**Timeline**: Phase 0 (2 weeks) + Phase 1 (8 weeks) + Phase 2 decision cycle
**Dependencies**: v22 objective evaluation artifacts + integration feasibility decision
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Current State**: Pilot DB schema, RLS policies, hardened admin function, internal pilot APIs, and pilot test suite are implemented and validated. Step 1 decision locks are complete; baseline M1/M3 execution is recorded (both `NULL` due to zero baseline-window events), but Gate 0 remains NO-GO until legal/privacy and partner-operation blockers are closed.

Reposition HelpBridge from potential directory duplication to measurable last-mile outcome value (connection success, reliability, referral completion), with explicit kill criteria if value is not demonstrated.

**👉 Detailed Plan: [v22.0 Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan](v22-0-non-duplicate-value-decision-plan.md)**
**👉 Approval Checklist: [v22.0 Step 1 Approval Checklist](v22-0-approval-checklist.md)**
**👉 Phase 0 Execution Spec: [v22.0 Phase 0 Implementation Plan](../implementation/v22-0-phase-0-implementation-plan.md)**
**👉 User-Owned Gate 0 Actions: [v22.0 Gate 0 User Action Tracker](../implementation/v22-0-gate-0-user-action-tracker.md)**
**👉 Evidence Intake Pack: [v22.0 Gate 0 Evidence Intake Pack](../implementation/v22-0-gate-0-evidence-intake-pack.md)**

#### Gate-Oriented Objectives

1. Prove non-duplicate value vs 211 on measurable connection outcomes.
2. Validate privacy-safe integration feasibility with 211 data pathways.
3. Keep strict stop conditions for initiatives that do not outperform baseline.

#### Remaining Required Actions (Gate 0)

1. `UA-1 / G0-3`: Attach candidate partner legal/API terms and complete clause-level C1 review (`2026-03-21` target).
2. `UA-2 / G0-4`: Lock field-level retention windows + deletion procedure and attach privacy sign-off (`2026-03-21` target).
3. `UA-3 / G0-8`: Attach named pilot partner list + outreach owner + execution evidence (`2026-03-21` target).
4. Keep sync discipline using [v22.0 Gate 0 User Action Tracker](../implementation/v22-0-gate-0-user-action-tracker.md) and [v22.0 Gate 0 Evidence Intake Pack](../implementation/v22-0-gate-0-evidence-intake-pack.md).
5. Re-evaluate Gate 0 using [v22.0 Gate 0 Exit Checklist (Decision Control)](../implementation/v22-0-gate-0-exit-checklist.md) after every accepted evidence update.

#### Gate 0 Exit Blockers (NO-GO)

1. Candidate partner legal/API terms are not yet attached for C1 clause-level review.
2. Retention windows and deletion procedure for C2 are not yet policy-locked.
3. D4 partner outreach execution evidence is not yet complete.
4. Baseline metrics are recorded but currently `NULL` for M1/M3 due to zero events in baseline window.

#### Completed in This Cycle

1. Pilot tables created with full CRUD RLS policies (`pilot_contact_attempt_events`, `pilot_referral_events`, `pilot_metric_snapshots`, `pilot_integration_feasibility_decisions`).
2. Legacy `user_metadata` admin gate removed from `bulk_update_service_status`; replaced with `is_admin()` check.
3. Internal pilot endpoints implemented and documented in OpenAPI/architecture docs.
4. Pilot API/schema/metrics tests added and passing.
5. Gate 0 decision control document added and linked across v22 artifacts.
6. Gate 0 user action tracker added and linked from roadmap.
7. Gate 0 evidence intake pack added for C1/C2/D4 submission standardization.
8. CI/release guard added (`npm run check:v22-gate0`) to block build/release paths while Gate 0 is `NO-GO`.
9. E2E skip baseline documented and linked in roadmap + v19 execution handoff.
10. Temporary free-tier CI budget mode enabled for Playwright E2E (manual dispatch or `[run-e2e]` on `main`).

#### Gate 1 Thresholds (Pilot Cycle 1)

- Failed contact attempts reduced by at least 30% vs baseline.
- Time-to-successful-connection reduced by at least 25%.
- Freshness SLA compliance at least 70%.
- Referral outcome capture at least 50%.
- Fatal data-decay error rate at or below 10%.

## 📋 Future Considerations

### v20.0: Technical Excellence & Testing (HIGH PRIORITY - Before Production)

**Status**: IN PROGRESS — 21/38 items complete; completed Phase 1 work is archived and the remaining backlog is split into “can proceed now” vs “wait for v22/v21 clarity”
**Priority**: HIGH (technical debt reduction and deeper test coverage)
**Remaining Effort**: ~35-45 hours
**Dependencies**: None, but execution should not displace v22 gate work
**Completion**: 21/38 items done
**Archive**: Completed v20.0 Phase 1 execution details live in [2026-02-12-v20-0-phase-1-implementation-plan.md](archive/2026-02-12-v20-0-phase-1-implementation-plan.md)

This roadmap section now tracks only the unfinished v20 backlog. Completed code quality, CI, and Phase 1 testing work has been removed from the active roadmap and preserved in the archive above.

#### Can Proceed Now

**Testing depth**

- `B5`: Add smoke tests for 40+ untested components
- `B6`: Stabilize the 7 skipped E2E tests without breaking the free-tier CI budget posture
- `B7`: Add unhappy-path and resilience scenario tests
- `B8`: Add end-to-end feedback workflow integration coverage
- `B9`: Add end-to-end service update request integration coverage

**Documentation and ops**

- `D2`: Create an admin operations guide
- `D4`: Add GDPR/international compliance documentation
- `D5`: Document database migration and rollback procedures
- `D6`: Refresh `docs/testing/performance-baselines.md` with current numbers

**Security and privacy**

- `F1`: Add deeper dependency scanning in CI
- `F2`: Add automated CSP/security-header verification at runtime
- `F3`: Expand rate-limit coverage across non-search API routes

**Architecture**

- `G2`: Extract the shared enhancer path in `hooks/useServices.ts`

These items are useful regardless of which strategic path v22 takes. Execute them only when they do not displace Gate 0 work.

#### Defer Until v22/v21 Clarity

**French and search enrichment**

- `C2`: Generate `synthetic_queries_fr` for the remaining services
- `C5`: Populate `access_script_fr` with reviewed translations
- `C6`: Generate and validate `hours_text_fr`

**Architecture**

- `G1`: Move search AI metadata out of JSON and into Supabase-backed storage
- `G3`: Build an admin-facing data quality dashboard

These items are still valuable, but they benefit from the partner, governance, and data-shape decisions that sit in the v22/v21 path. Keep them parked unless those dependencies become clearer.

#### Remaining Success Criteria

- Publish a fresh coverage snapshot and continue moving statement coverage toward 75%
- Reduce skipped E2E tests or keep every remaining skip explicitly documented
- Complete advanced French service-data coverage for the highest-value fields
- Close the remaining documentation and operational procedure gaps
- Tighten security and architecture follow-through without creating roadmap drift

### v21.0: Admissions Portfolio & Production Launch (PAUSED)

**Status**: PAUSED — Revisit after v22.0 Gate 1 decision
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Admissions Impact)
**Total Effort**: ~85–120 hours (mixed implementation + human-required work)
**Timeline**: 12 weeks (4 phases)
**Dependencies**: v19.0 documentation complete ✅
**Created**: 2026-02-25

Transform the project from "impressive prototype" to "deployed, validated, evidence-backed community tool" with real-world impact metrics and professional portfolio artifacts.

**Context**: Developed through a structured three-pass analysis (comprehensive scan → devil's advocate → steelman → objective synthesis) to maximize medical school application value while ensuring all recommendations are defensible and achievable.

**👉 Detailed Plan: [v21.0 Admissions Portfolio Plan](v21-admissions-portfolio-plan.md)**

#### Strategic Insight

The project now has a live deployment and strong documentation/governance infrastructure. The credibility gap is in **execution and external validation** — named partners, verified L3 services, outcome evidence, and documented professional adoption. Every item prioritizes execution of existing systems over building new ones.

#### Phase Summary

| Phase       | When       | Effort | Theme                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0** | Today      | <2h    | Immediate housekeeping (name on project, EDIA fix, git tags, ABS gap analysis)                                                               |
| **Phase 1** | Week 1     | 15–20h | Early production hardening (crisis test protocol, crisis-path component tests, geocoding, demo video)                                        |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 2–4  | 25–35h | Governance execution (first verification cycle, L3 outreach, French translations, impact page, project brief)                                |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 4–8  | 20–30h | External validation (advisory board, professional feedback sessions, community meeting, accessibility audit, published compliance summaries) |
| **Phase 4** | Weeks 8–12 | 25–35h | Evidence portfolio (partner endorsement, service gap analysis, volunteer pilot, grant application, final ABS)                                |

#### Key Design Decisions

- **Crisis test protocol is a deployment blocker** — the most ethically significant feature must be verified before going live
- **Impact page framed around governance metrics, not usage** — low early traffic would backfire; data quality metrics are compelling on day 1
- **User testing reframed as professional consultations** — front-line social workers (not students), framed as consultation (not research) to avoid ethics review requirements
- **French translations require native speaker review** — unreviewed translated crisis access scripts for vulnerable populations create liability
- **Partner endorsement at Week 8+** — must deploy, achieve L3s, and build relationships first
- **Component testing scoped to crisis path** — safety-driven engineering decision, not a coverage percentage target

#### Success Criteria

**Production Evidence:**

- [x] Live production URL with custom domain
- [ ] Crisis detection formally tested (20 scenarios documented)
- [ ] ≥85% geocoding coverage (up from 70%)
- [ ] Public status page operational

**Governance Evidence:**

- [ ] Professional feedback sessions documented (n≥3)
- [ ] ≥1 community engagement meeting documented
- [ ] ≥1 partner endorsement letter on file

**Portfolio Artifacts:**

- [ ] ABS-ready STAR narrative (150 words), fully substantiable
- [ ] 1-page project brief for professional referrers
- [ ] 2-minute demo video
- [ ] Impact page live (governance/data-quality framed)
- [ ] PIA and AI compliance summaries published
- [ ] Structural service gap analysis written and shared

### v22.1: Post-Launch Search Quality & UX Improvements (Deferred Candidate)

**Priority**: HIGH (After Beta Launch)
**Effort**: ~15-20 hours
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks post-launch

Improve search quality and user experience based on real-world usage patterns from beta testing.

**Note**: Deferred until v22.0 stage gates pass and launch path is re-confirmed.

#### Goals

1. **Search Quality Monitoring**: Understand when searches fail and why
2. **Expanded Search Vocabulary**: Cover practical crisis terminology users actually use
3. **Geographic Transparency**: Show users when results are incomplete due to missing location data
4. **Partner Feedback Loop**: Automatically alert partners when services need attention

#### Implementation Tasks

- **Task 1** (4-6h): Zero-Results Tracking & Admin Dashboard
  - Wire `zero-results.ts` pattern hashing into analytics table
  - Create admin view: "Top 10 failed query patterns this week" (hashed)
  - Weekly digest email with actionable search quality insights
  - Dashboard widgets: services with <50% helpfulness, categories with high "not found" feedback

- **Task 2** (2-3h): Synonym Dictionary Expansion
  - Add ~90 practical terms based on real zero-results data
  - **Utilities**: "hydro", "bill help", "water bill", "phone bill", "internet"
  - **Documents**: "birth certificate", "ID", "OHIP card", "SIN", "passport"
  - **Childcare**: "daycare", "babysitting", "childcare subsidy", "baby"
  - **Seniors**: "nursing home", "home care", "meals on wheels", "assisted living"
  - **Transportation**: "bus pass", "ride", "accessible transit", "mobility"
  - **Addiction**: "rehab", "aa", "na", "sober", "detox"
  - **Education**: "ged", "literacy", "esl", "tutoring"
  - **Youth**: "runaway", "foster care", "emancipation"

- **Task 3** (2h): Geographic Search Transparency UI
  - Badge in results: "Showing X nearby + Y more without location data"
  - Show services without coordinates at bottom of "near me" results
  - Add "Location unavailable" note instead of silent exclusion

- **Task 4** (3-4h): Feedback Auto-Alerting for Partners
  - Auto-tag feedback by type (data quality vs. user confusion)
  - Email partner when service gets >3 issue reports in 7 days
  - Admin dashboard: "Top 5 services needing attention" widget

#### Success Criteria

- Zero-results tracking captures 100% of failed searches (hashed for privacy)
- Synonym coverage increases from ~30 to ~150 entries
- Geographic filter shows result completeness to users
- Partners receive automated alerts within 24h of threshold breach
- Search quality dashboard shows actionable insights weekly

---

### v23.0: Community Engagement & Content Expansion (Planned)

**Priority**: MEDIUM (Post-Launch, User-Driven)
**Effort**: ~8-10 hours initial setup, ongoing moderation
**Timeline**: 3-6 months post-launch

Enable community-driven service suggestions with moderation workflow.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Public service submission form (authenticated or anonymous with verification)
- [ ] Moderation queue for admin review
- [ ] Auto-suggest services based on "not found" feedback patterns
- [ ] Partner notification when community suggests updates to their services

---

### Observability & Performance (Post-v18.0)

- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard (visualize circuit breaker state, p50/p95/p99 graphs over time)
- Automated load testing in CI (scheduled weekly k6 runs with automatic baseline comparison)
- Performance regression alerts on pull requests (fail builds if latency degrades >20%)
- Lighthouse CI budget checks for bundle size and Core Web Vitals

### Advanced Resilience (Deprioritized)

The following items are over-engineering for current scale and are **not recommended** unless specific production issues emerge:

- ~~Enhanced circuit breaker features (per-operation, dynamic thresholds, predictive)~~ - Current static config works well
- ~~Multi-region resilience (database replica failover)~~ - Single-region Supabase is sufficient for Kingston
- ~~Cached authorization with Redis~~ - In-memory approach is fine at current scale

### API & Integration (Partner-Driven)

The following items should only be pursued if partners express specific needs:

- GraphQL API - **Skip unless requested** (REST is sufficient for current use cases)
- Webhooks - **Wait for partner demand** (no active integrations yet)
- API keys & server-to-server auth - **Wait for third-party integration requests**
- Public API documentation - **Consider** (OpenAPI spec exists at `docs/api/openapi.yaml`, needs publishing)

### Data & Content

- ✅ **Automated data staleness detection** - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (monthly GitHub Action workflow)
- **Community-driven service suggestions** - See v23.0 planned work above
- **Multi-language support expansion** - Add Korean, Ukrainian based on demographic needs (data-driven decision)
- ~~Enhanced search: Fuzzy matching, typo tolerance~~ - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Levenshtein distance, max 2 edits)
- **Voice search improvements** - Consider if user feedback indicates demand

## 🚨 Pre-Launch Blockers (Must Complete Before Beta)

Based on comprehensive codebase audit (2026-02-09):

### Critical Items (Block Launch)

1. **SEO & Discoverability** (~3-4h)
   - [x] Add `/robots.txt` crawl directives (implemented via `/app/robots.ts`)
   - [x] Add `/app/sitemap.ts` route handler
   - [x] Add `/app/[locale]/not-found.tsx` branded 404 page
   - [x] Add route-level `/app/[locale]/error.tsx` error boundaries

2. **Security Contact** (~15min)
   - [x] Add `/public/.well-known/security.txt` per RFC 9116

3. **Code Quality** (~1h)
   - [x] Replace `console.*` with `logger.*` in 7 API routes:
     - `/app/api/v1/feedback/route.ts`
     - `/app/api/v1/notifications/subscribe/route.ts`
     - `/app/api/v1/notifications/unsubscribe/route.ts`

### Recommended (High Priority, Not Blocking)

6. **Input Validation Hardening** (~1h)
   - Stricten `field_updates: z.record(z.any())` in `/app/api/v1/services/[id]/update-request/route.ts`
   - Use explicit allowed field list instead of `any()`

7. **CORS Configuration** (~30min)
   - Add explicit CORS middleware if API will be consumed externally
   - Can defer if internal-only
