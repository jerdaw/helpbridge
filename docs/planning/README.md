## Quick Reference

### What is v18.0?

**v18.0: Production Observability & Operational Excellence**

The final infrastructure layer before production launch. Completes circuit breaker rollout, adds production monitoring, alerting, SLO tracking, and operational documentation.

### Why Now?

Platform is technically ready but lacks:

- Complete circuit breaker coverage (40% → 100%)
- Production monitoring (metrics disappear on restart)
- Automated alerting (can't detect incidents)
- Public status page (no transparency)
- Operational runbooks (ad-hoc troubleshooting)

### Timeline

**4 weeks, 24-32 hours of work**

- Week 1: Circuit breaker rollout
- Week 2: Monitoring infrastructure
- Week 3: SLOs + documentation
- Week 4: Validation + launch approval

### Cost

**$20/month** (unchanged from current)
All monitoring tools use free tiers.

### Dependencies

User needs to sign up for:

- Axiom (metrics) - FREE
- Slack webhook (alerts) - FREE
- Upptime (status page) - FREE

**Total setup time:** ~20 minutes
