## Quick Reference

### What is v22.0?

**v22.0: Non-Duplicate Value Decision Plan**

The current strategic planning track for proving non-duplicate value relative to 211 through measured connection outcomes, strict privacy constraints, and explicit kill criteria.

### Why Now?

The platform is technically mature, but the next decision is strategic rather than purely technical:

- Avoid direct breadth competition with 211
- Validate measurable last-mile outcome value
- Keep governance and privacy redlines explicit before expanding pilot work

### Timeline

**Target ~90-day decision review cycle**

- Phase 0: baseline + governance locks
- Phase 1: pilot execution
- Phase 2: objective go / conditional / stop decision

This is a decision checkpoint target, not a guaranteed delivery schedule. The review window assumes external blockers such as legal review and partner evidence close in time to support a meaningful decision.

### Cost

Pilot cost remains bounded by existing infrastructure and partner participation assumptions documented in the v22 plan.

### Dependencies

Current dependencies:

- Gate 0 blocker closure (`C1`, `D4`)
- Baseline evidence already published
- Integration feasibility decision already recorded in conditional mode
- Offline/local threat-model completion already recorded

---

## How to Proceed

### Option 1: Close Gate 0

Use the active roadmap and Gate 0 tracker to close the remaining blocking items:

1. Attach candidate partner legal/API terms for C1 review
2. Attach named pilot partner and outreach execution evidence for D4

### Option 2: Ask Questions

Review documents and ask clarifying questions about scope, timeline, or approach.

### Option 3: Request Changes

Propose modifications to scope, timeline, or implementation strategy.
