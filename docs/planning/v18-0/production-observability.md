# v18.0: Production Observability & Operational Excellence

**Status:** PLANNING
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Effort:** 24-32 hours (4-5 days)
**Target Completion:** 2026-02-26

---

## Overview

Complete the operational foundation for production launch by finishing the v17.5/v17.6 rollout and adding production-grade monitoring, alerting, and operational documentation.

## Goals

1. **Complete Circuit Breaker Rollout:** Achieve 100% coverage on all API routes
2. **Production Monitoring:** Integrate with Axiom for persistent metrics
3. **Observability Dashboard:** Real-time system health visualization
4. **Alerting System:** Automated notifications for critical issues
5. **SLO Framework:** Define and track service level objectives
6. **Operational Readiness:** Runbooks, incident response plans, status page

## Why v18.0 Now?

**Current State:**

- v17.6 complete with core resilience infrastructure (circuit breaker, performance tracking)
- Platform is production-ready but lacks production-grade observability
- Incomplete rollout from v17.5+ (40% circuit breaker coverage, failing integration tests)
- No monitoring/alerting infrastructure for production incidents

**Gap:**
Without completing this work, production deployment risks:

- Inability to detect incidents quickly
- No systematic way to measure reliability
- Difficult troubleshooting during outages
- No transparency to users about system status

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Complete Circuit Breaker Rollout (8-10 hours)

- Protect 8 remaining API routes with circuit breaker
- Fix 3 failing integration tests (timing issues)
- Document performance baselines from load tests
- Secure metrics endpoint with authentication

**Deliverables:**

- 100% circuit breaker coverage
- All tests passing (537 → 540+ tests)
- Performance baselines documented
- Metrics API secured

---

### Phase 2: Production Monitoring Infrastructure (10-12 hours)

- Integrate with Axiom for persistent metrics (free tier, 500GB/month)
- Build observability dashboard at `/admin/observability`
- Configure alerting (Slack + email) with smart throttling
- Create 4 operational runbooks (circuit open, high error rate, slow queries, DB migration)

**Deliverables:**

- Real-time performance metrics in production
- Admin dashboard with circuit breaker status, latency charts, incident timeline
- Automated alerts for critical issues (circuit open, high error rate, DB down)
- Step-by-step incident response procedures

---

### Phase 3: Service Level Objectives (4-6 hours)

- Define SLOs (99.5% uptime, p95 <800ms, <5% error rate)
- Build SLO monitoring dashboard with error budget tracking
- Deploy public status page (Upptime on GitHub Actions)

**Deliverables:**

- Measurable reliability targets
- SLO compliance dashboard
- Public status page at `status.kingstoncare.ca`
- Transparent uptime reporting

---

### Phase 4: Operational Documentation (2-4 hours)

- Update CLAUDE.md with observability patterns
- Create production deployment checklist
- Document incident response plan with severity levels and roles

**Deliverables:**

- Comprehensive operational documentation
- Production launch checklist (15 items)
- Incident response playbook

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical

- ✅ 100% API route circuit breaker protection
- ✅ All integration tests passing (no flakiness)
- ✅ Axiom integration live with <5ms overhead
- ✅ Observability dashboard loads in <2s
- ✅ Alerts fire correctly (tested via simulation)

### Operational

- ✅ SLO compliance >90% in first month
- ✅ Mean time to detection (MTTD) <5min for critical issues
- ✅ Public status page uptime tracking
- ✅ Team trained on incident response procedures

### Business

- ✅ Production-ready monitoring infrastructure
- ✅ Transparent reliability reporting to stakeholders
- ✅ Reduced incident resolution time via automated alerts
- ✅ Foundation for scaling to 10x traffic

## Timeline

**Week 1 (Jan 30 - Feb 5):** Phase 1 - Circuit Breaker Rollout
**Week 2 (Feb 6 - Feb 12):** Phase 2 - Monitoring Infrastructure
**Week 3 (Feb 13 - Feb 19):** Phase 3 (SLOs) + Phase 4 (Documentation)
**Week 4 (Feb 20 - Feb 26):** Validation, Testing, Production Readiness

**Milestone:** v18.0 production-ready, launch approved

---

## Dependencies

### Required (User Action)

- ⚠️ **Axiom Account:** Sign up at axiom.co (free tier)
- ⚠️ **Slack Webhook:** Create incoming webhook in workspace
- ⚠️ **Domain:** Configure `status.kingstoncare.ca` subdomain

### Optional

- ⏳ Supabase Pro tier (better performance, not required for launch)
- ⏳ Dedicated Sentry account (error tracking)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                           | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integration tests remain flaky | Medium     | Medium | Use fake timers, reduce timeout to 5s, validate 10x runs             |
| Axiom ingestion overhead       | Low        | Medium | Async batching (60s), <5ms overhead target, fail-safe error handling |
| Alert fatigue                  | Medium     | Low    | Smart throttling (10min), severity levels, dry-run testing           |
| Performance regression         | Low        | High   | Load test validation, <5% latency increase acceptable, rollback plan |

## Cost Analysis

**Total Monthly Cost:** $20/month (Vercel Pro only)

All monitoring tools are free-tier compatible:

- Axiom: Free (500GB/month, estimated 10GB actual)
- Upptime: Free (GitHub Actions)
- Slack: Free (webhook only)
- Resend: Free (<100 emails/month)

**Scaling Path:** If traffic exceeds free tiers → Supabase Pro ($25/mo) + Axiom Team ($25/mo) = $70/mo total
