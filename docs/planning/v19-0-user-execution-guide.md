3. **Make launch decision** (45 min):
   - **Score >4.0:** ✅ **READY FOR FULL PUBLIC LAUNCH**
   - **Score 3.5-4.0:** ⚠️ Address concerns, then launch
   - **Score 3.0-3.5:** ⏸️ Extend soft launch, fix major issues
   - **Score <3.0:** 🚫 Not ready, significant work needed

## Questions & Troubleshooting

### "What if I find a critical bug during QA?"

- **Stop.** Don't proceed to beta.
- **Fix immediately.**
- **Re-test** that specific scenario.
- **Verify** no regressions.
- **Then** continue QA.

### "What if crisis search doesn't work?"

- **This is BLOCKING.** Do not proceed to beta under any circumstances.
- **Fix immediately** before any users access the platform.
- **Lives depend on this working perfectly.**

### "What if accessibility fails?"

- **This is BLOCKING.** Legal requirement (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- **Fix before beta.**
- **Re-test with keyboard and screen reader.**
- **Verify** all interactions work without mouse.

### "What if I can't recruit beta users?"

- **Quality over quantity.** Start with 5-10 trusted users.
- **Week 1** can be smaller if needed.
- **Extend Week 1** instead of rushing to Week 2.
- **Key:** Get diverse feedback (different use cases, devices, accessibility needs).

### "What if I don't have time for daily monitoring?"

- **Daily monitoring is critical** during beta.
- **15-20 min/day** is minimum safe amount.
- **If truly unavailable:** Extend beta phases (Week 1 = 2 weeks, etc.)
- **Don't skip** - monitoring prevents disasters.

### "Can I skip beta testing entirely?"

- **Not recommended.** Beta testing finds issues before public sees them.
- **If you must:** At minimum, do Week 1 with 5-10 trusted users.
- **Risk:** Public launch with unknown bugs = bad user experience.

### "What if scorecard is <4.0?"

- **Don't launch yet.**
- **Review low-scoring categories.**
- **Fix major issues.**
- **Extend soft launch 1-2 weeks.**
- **Re-assess scorecard.**
- **Launch when ready (>4.0), not on schedule.**

### "What if there's a critical issue on launch day?"

- **Stay calm.**
- **Follow rollback procedures** in `docs/operations/launch-rollback-procedures.md`
- **SEV-1 = rollback in <5 minutes** via Vercel dashboard
- **Communicate** using templates in `docs/operations/communication-templates.md`
- **Fix issue, re-deploy, monitor closely.**
