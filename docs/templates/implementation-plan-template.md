### [Another Component]

1.  **Zod for API Validation**: All API write endpoints (POST, PUT, PATCH) must use Zod schemas to validate request bodies before processing.
    - **Rationale**: Zod provides runtime validation that infers static TypeScript types, ensuring the runtime data matches our compile-time expectations.
2.  **Linting in Tests**: The `tests/` directory is no longer excluded from ESLint.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests

- [ ] Unit tests: `npm test -- pattern`
- [ ] E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] TypeScript: `npm run typecheck`

### Manual Verification

- [ ] Verify [specific behavior] in dev environment
- [ ] Test edge case: [describe scenario]

## Dependencies

- [Prerequisite work or external dependencies]

## Migration Path

- [Steps to upgrade from previous version, if applicable]
