# Production Deployment Checklist

**Version:** 2.0

## Overview

This is the active production checklist for HelpBridge on the direct-VPS path.

- **Public host:** `https://helpbridge.ca`
- **Redirect alias:** `https://www.helpbridge.ca` -> apex
- **Runtime:** Docker on the Hetzner VPS
- **Ingress:** host Caddy
- **Private bind:** `127.0.0.1:3300`
- **Env file:** `/etc/projects-merge/env/kingston-care-connect-web.env`

GitHub Actions posture:

- CI runs automatically on push/PR.
- The `Production Smoke` workflow is the manual GitHub-side public verification step.
- Production deploys remain manual on the VPS using `scripts/deploy-vps-proof.sh`.

If you intentionally need the historical Vercel path, see the root
[`DEPLOY.md`](../../DEPLOY.md). Do not treat that file as the production
baseline.

## 1. Local Verification

- [ ] `git status` is clean
- [ ] `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run type-check`
- [ ] `npm run build`
- [ ] relevant Vitest suites pass
- [ ] no secrets were added to tracked files

Do not run Playwright locally for routine deployment verification. Leave E2E
coverage to CI.

## 2. Data And Schema Safety

If the deploy changes database structure, policies, or seed data:

- [ ] migration reviewed and committed
- [ ] rollback SQL or compensating step documented
- [ ] `npm run validate-data`
- [ ] `npm run db:verify`
- [ ] any required embeddings regeneration completed

If the change touches Supabase RLS around `organization_members` or `services`,
preserve the helper-function-based recursion repair captured in:

- [`supabase/migrations/20260311032000_fix_rls_recursion_for_org_members_and_services.sql`](../../supabase/migrations/20260311032000_fix_rls_recursion_for_org_members_and_services.sql)

## 3. Environment Review

Verify the VPS env file contains the required runtime values:

```bash
sudo grep -E '^(NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL|NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY|NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL|NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL|NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_MODE|NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID|NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SEARCH_PERF_TRACKING)=' \
  /etc/projects-merge/env/kingston-care-connect-web.env
```

Expected production host values:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://helpbridge.ca`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://helpbridge.ca`

Important:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` must be available at both image build time and container runtime.
- `scripts/deploy-vps-proof.sh` is the supported path because it passes the required public values into the Docker build before the container starts.

Optional integrations such as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `AXIOM_*`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`
may be unset if they are not in active use.

## 4. Release Staging

- [ ] create or update a release directory under `/srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/releases/`
- [ ] point `/srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current` at the intended release
- [ ] confirm `scripts/deploy-vps-proof.sh` exists in the staged release

Example:

```bash
readlink -f /srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current
ls /srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current/scripts/deploy-vps-proof.sh
```

## 5. Deploy

From the staged release on the VPS:

```bash
cd /srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current
./scripts/deploy-vps-proof.sh /etc/projects-merge/env/kingston-care-connect-web.env
```

- [ ] a new image tag is produced
- [ ] the `kingston-care-connect-web` container is replaced cleanly
- [ ] the bind remains `127.0.0.1:3300->3000`

## 6. Private Verification

Run on the VPS:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=kingston-care-connect-web
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3300/api/v1/health
curl -sS -D - "http://127.0.0.1:3300/api/v1/services?limit=1"
docker logs --tail 50 kingston-care-connect-web
```

- [ ] health returns JSON
- [ ] services endpoint returns `200`
- [ ] logs do not show a crash loop

## 7. Public Verification

Run from a workstation:

```bash
curl -I https://helpbridge.ca
curl -I https://www.helpbridge.ca
curl -fsS https://helpbridge.ca/api/v1/health
curl -fsS https://helpbridge.ca/robots.txt
curl -fsS https://helpbridge.ca/sitemap.xml | sed -n '1,12p'
```

- [ ] apex returns a normal app response
- [ ] `www` returns `308` to apex
- [ ] public health returns healthy JSON
- [ ] `robots.txt` points at `https://helpbridge.ca/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] sitemap URLs use `https://helpbridge.ca/...`

## 8. Caddy Verification

Run on the VPS:

```bash
sudo systemctl status caddy --no-pager --lines=20
sudo journalctl -u caddy --since "10 minutes ago" --no-pager
```

- [ ] Caddy is active
- [ ] no repeated TLS or proxy failures for `helpbridge.ca`

## 9. Short Observation Window

After cutover, keep the service under short observation:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=kingston-care-connect-web
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3300/api/v1/health
curl -fsS https://helpbridge.ca/api/v1/health
free -h
```

- [ ] private health remains healthy
- [ ] public health remains healthy
- [ ] memory remains within expected host capacity

## 10. Rollback

If the new release is bad:

1. repoint `/srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current` to the last known good release
2. redeploy using the same env file
3. re-run the private and public verification steps

Example:

```bash
ln -sfn /srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/releases/<previous-release> \
  /srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current
cd /srv/apps/kingston-care-connect-web/current
./scripts/deploy-vps-proof.sh /etc/projects-merge/env/kingston-care-connect-web.env
```
