## Overview

### Purpose

This plan defines Kingston Care Connect's approach to detecting, responding to, and resolving production incidents. The goal is to minimize user impact and restore normal service as quickly as possible.

### Scope

This plan covers all production incidents affecting:

- Search functionality
- Service data availability
- User authentication/authorization
- Partner dashboard
- API endpoints
- Database availability
- Performance degradation

### Principles

1. **User-First:** Minimize user impact above all else
2. **Transparency:** Communicate openly about incidents
3. **Rapid Response:** Acknowledge within 15 minutes, contain within 1 hour
4. **Learn & Improve:** Every incident is a learning opportunity
5. **Blameless:** Focus on systems, not individuals

---

---

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Alerting

**Detection Sources:**

1. **Automated Monitoring:**
   - Slack alerts (circuit breaker, error rates)
   - Axiom alerts (custom queries)
   - Vercel deployment failures
   - Health check failures

2. **User Reports:**
   - Support emails
   - Social media mentions
   - Partner dashboard feedback

3. **Proactive Monitoring:**
   - Observability dashboard review
   - Manual smoke tests
   - Third-party monitoring (if configured)

**Alert Channels:**

- **Slack:** `#kingston-alerts` (automated + manual)
- **Email:** alerts@kingstoncare.ca (backup)
- **Phone:** (Future: PagerDuty integration)

---

### Phase 2: Acknowledgment & Triage

**Within 5-15 minutes of detection (based on severity):**

**Step 1: Acknowledge**

- [ ] Confirm alert is not a false positive
- [ ] Post in #kingston-alerts: "🚨 Incident acknowledged, investigating"
- [ ] Assign incident number: `INC-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (e.g., INC-20260203-001)

**Step 2: Assess Severity**

Use severity matrix above to classify incident:

```
SEV-1: Complete outage, critical functionality broken
SEV-2: Major degradation, subset of users affected
SEV-3: Minor impairment, workarounds available
SEV-4: Minimal impact, cosmetic issues
```

**Step 3: Initiate Response**

- [ ] Assign Incident Commander (SEV-1, SEV-2)
- [ ] Create incident channel: `#inc-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (SEV-1, SEV-2)
- [ ] Pull in additional engineers if needed
- [ ] Start incident timeline (timestamp all actions)

**Template Message:**

```
🚨 INCIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED: INC-20260203-001

Severity: SEV-2 (High)
Issue: Search returning no results for food bank queries
Impact: Subset of users unable to find food assistance services
Start Time: 2026-02-03 14:23 UTC
Incident Commander: @engineer
Status: Investigating

Dashboard: https://kingstoncare.ca/admin/observability
Runbook: https://github.com/.../docs/runbooks/high-error-rate.md

Updates will be posted every 30 minutes.
```

---

### Phase 3: Investigation & Diagnosis

**Systematic Troubleshooting:**

**Step 1: Gather Context**

- [ ] Check observability dashboard (`/admin/observability`)
- [ ] Review recent deployments (last 24 hours)
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs
- [ ] Review Axiom events
- [ ] Check circuit breaker status
- [ ] Review database status (Supabase dashboard)

**Step 2: Identify Root Cause**

Use appropriate runbook:

- Circuit breaker open → `docs/runbooks/circuit-breaker-open.md`
- High error rates → `docs/runbooks/high-error-rate.md`
- Slow queries → `docs/runbooks/slow-queries.md`

**Step 3: Form Hypothesis**

Document working theory:

```
Hypothesis: Recent deployment introduced bug in search scoring logic
Evidence: Error rate spiked at 14:15 UTC, 10 minutes after deployment
Next Step: Review diff of search/scoring.ts changes
```

---

### Phase 4: Mitigation & Resolution

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Option A: Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)**

Use when:

- Recent deployment is root cause
- Issue is severe (SEV-1, SEV-2)
- Quick rollback is safe

```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback <LAST_KNOWN_GOOD_URL>

# Verify service restored
curl https://kingstoncare.ca/api/v1/health
```

**Option B: Hotfix Deployment (15-30 minutes)**

Use when:

- Issue identified and fix is simple
- Rollback not possible (schema changes)
- Fix can be deployed quickly

```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/inc-20260203-001

# Make minimal fix
# Test locally
npm test -- --run
npm run build

# Deploy
git push origin hotfix/inc-20260203-001
# Create PR, merge, auto-deploy
```

**Option C: Workaround (varies)**

Use when:

- Root cause unclear
- Fix requires significant development
- Temporary workaround available

Examples:

- Route traffic to fallback endpoints
- Enable maintenance mode
- Disable problematic feature
- Manual data correction

---

### Phase 5: Verification

**Confirm Resolution:**

- [ ] Core functionality restored
- [ ] Error rates returned to normal (<1%)
- [ ] Circuit breaker stable (CLOSED)
- [ ] Performance metrics normal (p95 <800ms)
- [ ] No new alerts triggered
- [ ] User reports stopped

**Smoke Tests:**

```bash
# Test critical paths
curl https://kingstoncare.ca/api/v1/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}

curl https://kingstoncare.ca/api/v1/services
# Expected: 196+ services

curl -X POST https://kingstoncare.ca/api/v1/search/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"food bank"}'
# Expected: 10+ results
```

**User Validation:**

- [ ] Test affected functionality as end user
- [ ] Verify mobile app works (if applicable)
- [ ] Check PWA offline mode works
- [ ] Verify authentication flow
- [ ] Test partner dashboard

---

# Post-Incident Review: INC-YYYYMMDD-NNN

## Incident Summary

**Incident ID:** INC-20260203-001
**Severity:** SEV-2 (High)
**Duration:** 47 minutes
**Incident Commander:** @engineer
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Impact

**User Impact:**

- 0 data loss, 0 security impact

**Business Impact:**

- Potential trust impact (service reliability)
- No revenue impact (free service)

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 14:15      | Deploy #123 completed                  |
| 14:23      | Slack alert: High error rate detected  |
| 14:25      | Incident acknowledged, IC assigned     |
| 14:30      | Root cause identified (deployment)     |
| 14:35      | Rollback initiated                     |
| 14:40      | Service restored                       |
| 15:10      | Verification complete, incident closed |

## Root Cause

**Technical:**

- Bug in `lib/search/scoring.ts` line 145
- Division by zero when no results matched
- Not caught in unit tests (edge case)

**Contributing Factors:**

- Insufficient test coverage for edge cases
- No integration test for zero-result scenarios
- No staged rollout (100% traffic immediately)

**Five Whys:**

1. Why did search fail? → Division by zero error
2. Why division by zero? → No results matched query
3. Why not caught in tests? → Edge case not tested
4. Why edge case not tested? → Test coverage gap
5. Why coverage gap? → Scoring logic tests focus on happy path

## What Went Well

✅ Fast detection (8 minutes via automated alerts)
✅ Rapid rollback (15 minutes to resolution)
✅ Clear communication and updates
✅ Runbooks helpful for troubleshooting
✅ No data loss or security impact

## What Could Be Improved

❌ Test coverage for edge cases
❌ No staged rollout strategy
❌ Integration tests don't cover zero-results
❌ Monitoring didn't catch pre-production

## Action Items

| Action                                     | Owner | Due Date   | Priority |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Add edge case tests for scoring.ts         | @dev1 | 2026-02-05 | High     |
| Implement staged rollout (5% → 50% → 100%) | @dev2 | 2026-02-10 | Medium   |
| Add integration test for zero-results      | @dev1 | 2026-02-05 | High     |
| Update runbook with this scenario          | @ic   | 2026-02-04 | Low      |
| Review test coverage in CI                 | @dev2 | 2026-02-07 | Medium   |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Testing:** Edge cases are as important as happy paths
2. **Deployment:** Staged rollouts catch issues before full impact
3. **Monitoring:** Early warning systems work (caught in 8 min)
4. **Runbooks:** Having procedures accelerates resolution

## Prevention Measures

**Short-term:**

- Add comprehensive edge case tests
- Increase test coverage threshold to 80%

**Long-term:**

- Implement canary deployments (5% traffic first)
- Add synthetic monitoring (automated smoke tests post-deploy)
- Consider feature flags for risky changes
