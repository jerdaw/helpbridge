## 1. Production Environment Audit (2 hours)

**Goal:** Verify production environment is correctly configured and secure.

### 1.1: Environment Variables Verification (30 minutes)

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Access production environment**
  - Log into Vercel dashboard
  - Navigate to project → Settings → Environment Variables

  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (anon key)
  - [ ] `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (service role key)
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_MODE` (should be `local` or `server`)

- [ ] **Verify observability variables (v18.0):**
  - [ ] `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (for alerts)
  - [ ] `AXIOM_TOKEN` (metrics storage)
  - [ ] `AXIOM_ORG_ID` (organization ID)
  - [ ] `AXIOM_DATASET` (dataset name, e.g., `kingston-care-production`)

- [ ] **Verify optional variables (if used):**
  - [ ] `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (phone validation)
  - [ ] `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (phone validation)
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (push notifications)
  - [ ] `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (push notifications)

- [ ] **Cross-reference with `.env.example`**

  - Navigate to Authentication → Policies
  - Confirm policies exist for `services`, `organizations`, `organization_memberships` tables

- [ ] **Test RLS policies:**
  - [ ] Try to read `services` table without auth (should succeed - public read)
  - [ ] Try to insert into `services` table without auth (should fail)
  - [ ] Try to update `services` table without auth (should fail)
  - [ ] Try to access `organization_memberships` without auth (should fail)
