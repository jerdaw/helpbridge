# Beta Feedback Analysis Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date Created:** 2026-02-09
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-09
**Purpose:** Systematic approach to collecting, analyzing, and acting on beta user feedback

---

## Overview

This framework ensures all beta feedback is captured, categorized, prioritized, and acted upon systematically. No feedback gets lost, every user feels heard, and improvements are data-driven.

**Core Principles:**

- **Listen actively:** Every piece of feedback is valuable
- **Respond quickly:** Acknowledge within 24 hours
- **Act decisively:** Fix P0/P1 issues immediately
- **Communicate transparently:** Tell users what was done
- **Learn continuously:** Every phase informs the next

## Feedback Collection System

### Collection Channels

**1. In-App Feedback Widget**

- Already implemented in platform
- Users click feedback button → form appears
- Captures: feedback type, message, category (optional)
- Storage: Supabase database
- Monitoring: Check `/admin/dashboard` daily

**2. Email (beta-feedback@kingstoncare.ca)**

- Direct email from users
- More detailed feedback expected
- Attachments supported (screenshots)
- Monitoring: Check twice daily

**3. Surveys (per phase)**

- **Phase 1:** Detailed survey (12 questions)
- **Phase 2:** Medium survey (7 questions)
- **Phase 3:** Quick survey (4 questions)

## Feedback Analysis Methods

### Quantitative Analysis

**Metrics to Track:**

**Volume Metrics:**

- Total feedback items
- Feedback per user (engagement indicator)
- Feedback by source (widget vs. email vs. survey)
- Feedback by phase (Phase 1 vs. 2 vs. 3)

**Type Distribution:**

- Bug reports: X%
- Feature requests: X%
- UX issues: X%
- Data quality: X%
- Positive feedback: X%

**Priority Distribution:**

- P0 (Critical): X
- P1 (High): X
- P2 (Medium): X
- P3 (Low): X

**Resolution Metrics:**

- Resolution rate: X% closed
- Average time to resolution:
  - P0: X hours
  - P1: X days
  - P2: X days
- Reopen rate: X% (fixed items reported again)

**Sentiment:**

- Positive: X%
- Neutral: X%
- Negative: X%

**Trend:** Sentiment should improve over time as bugs are fixed.

### Qualitative Analysis

**Thematic Analysis:**

**1. Code feedback into themes**

Group similar feedback:

- "Search is confusing" + "Don't understand filters" = **Theme: Search UX**
- "Map doesn't load" + "Map is slow" = **Theme: Map performance**
- "Love offline mode" + "Works without WiFi!" = **Theme: Offline mode success**

**2. Count frequency**

| Theme                     | Count | Priority   |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Search UX confusion       | 8     | High       |
| Map performance           | 5     | Medium     |
| Offline mode (positive)   | 12    | N/A (keep) |
| French translation errors | 3     | Medium     |

**3. Prioritize by impact**

Consider:

- **Frequency:** How many users mentioned it?
- **Severity:** How much does it affect UX?
- **Effort:** How hard to fix?
- **Alignment:** Does it match our goals?

**Formula:**
Impact Score = (Frequency × Severity) / Effort

**Example:**

- Search UX (8 users, High severity, Medium effort) = High priority
- French errors (3 users, Medium severity, Low effort) = Medium priority

**4. Extract actionable insights**

From "Search is confusing":

- **Specific issue:** Users don't know difference between categories and keywords
- **Root cause:** No onboarding or hints
- **Action:** Add placeholder text with examples
- **Owner:** [Assign]
- **Timeline:** Week 2 of beta

**User Quotes:**

Save powerful quotes:

- **Positive:** "This saved me 20 minutes! Usually takes forever to find services."
- **Constructive:** "I didn't realize I could search in French until I saw the language button."
- **Critical:** "The map is so slow it's unusable on my phone."

**Use for:**

- Testimonials (positive)
- Marketing copy (positive)
- Prioritization (critical)
- Design improvements (constructive)

## Decision Framework

### When to Fix vs. Defer

**Fix Immediately:**

- ✅ P0 bugs (always)
- ✅ P1 bugs affecting >10% of users
- ✅ Accessibility blockers
- ✅ Data quality for crisis services
- ✅ Security issues

**Fix Before Next Phase:**

- ✅ P1 bugs affecting <10% of users
- ✅ Major UX confusion (>5 reports)
- ✅ Data quality for high-traffic services
- ✅ Performance degradation

**Defer to Post-Beta:**

- ✅ P2/P3 bugs (minor impact)
- ✅ Feature requests (not critical)
- ✅ Nice-to-have UX improvements
- ✅ Cosmetic issues

**Won't Fix:**

- ✅ Out of scope (e.g., "Add job postings")
- ✅ Contradicts privacy principles (e.g., "Track my searches")
- ✅ Unsustainable maintenance burden
- ✅ Requested by only 1 user and very niche

### When to Implement Feature Requests

**Criteria:**

1. **Alignment:** Does it match our mission (help people find social services)?
2. **Frequency:** How many users requested it?
3. **Impact:** How much does it improve the experience?
4. **Effort:** How hard to build?
5. **Maintenance:** Can we sustain it long-term?

**Decision Matrix:**

| Requests      | Alignment | Frequency  | Impact | Effort | Decision                     |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Save searches | Yes       | High (8)   | Medium | Medium | **Implement** (post-beta)    |
| Dark mode     | Neutral   | Medium (4) | Low    | Low    | **Maybe** (low priority)     |
| Job postings  | No        | Low (1)    | N/A    | High   | **Won't fix** (out of scope) |
| Export to PDF | Yes       | Low (2)    | Low    | Medium | **Defer** (low ROI)          |
