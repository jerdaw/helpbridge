## Notes

**Monitoring Philosophy:**

- Be proactive, not reactive
- Document everything
- Communicate early and often
- Don't panic - follow procedures

**When to Escalate:**

- Critical errors (SEV-1) immediately
- High error rates (SEV-2) within 15 minutes
- SLO violations within 30 minutes
- Uncertain situations - when in doubt, escalate

**Remember:**

- Users depend on this platform in crisis situations
- Fast detection and response save lives
- Good monitoring enables continuous improvement
