## Incident Response Process

### Severity Levels

| Level           | Response Time | Examples                                            |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 **Critical** | <15 min       | Circuit breaker open, complete outage, data breach  |
| 🟡 **Warning**  | <1 hour       | High error rate, slow queries, degraded performance |
| 🟢 **Info**     | <4 hours      | Recovery notifications, maintenance windows         |

### Response Time Targets

**Critical Incidents:**

- Detection → Response: <5 minutes
- Response → Diagnosis: <5 minutes
- Diagnosis → Fix: <10 minutes
- Total MTTR: <15 minutes

**Warning Incidents:**

- Detection → Response: <15 minutes
- Response → Diagnosis: <15 minutes
- Diagnosis → Fix: <30 minutes
- Total MTTR: <1 hour

### Escalation Matrix

```
Level 1: On-Call Engineer (You)
   ↓ (if unresolved after 30 min OR severity escalates)
Level 2: Senior Engineer / Team Lead
   ↓ (if unresolved after 1 hour OR major incident)
Level 3: Incident Commander + CTO
   ↓ (if PR impact OR security incident)
Level 4: External Support (Supabase, Vercel)
```

**When to Escalate:**

- Issue unresolved after time window
- Severity escalates (warning → critical)
- Root cause unclear
- Expertise needed beyond your level
- Security incident detected
- Public relations impact
- Customer SLA breach

**How to Escalate:**

1. **Gather context:**
   - Incident timeline
   - Steps already taken
   - Current status
   - Logs and error messages

2. **Notify next level:**
   - Slack: `@mention` in `#kingston-incidents`
   - (Future: PagerDuty page)

3. **Continue working:**
   - Don't wait idle
   - Keep investigating
   - Document findings

---

## Post-Incident Process

After resolving an incident:

### 1. Document Timeline

Record in incident log:

- **Detection time:** When alert fired or issue reported
- **Response time:** When investigation began
- **Diagnosis time:** When root cause identified
- **Resolution time:** When fix deployed
- **Verification time:** When confirmed resolved
- **Total downtime:** User-facing impact duration

**Example:**

```
Incident: Circuit Breaker Open
Detection:   2026-01-31 14:23:15 UTC (Slack alert)
Response:    2026-01-31 14:24:32 UTC (+1:17)
Diagnosis:   2026-01-31 14:28:45 UTC (+4:13)
Resolution:  2026-01-31 14:32:10 UTC (+3:25)
Verification: 2026-01-31 14:47:10 UTC (+15:00)
Total MTTR:  8:55 (within <15min target ✅)
Downtime:    None (graceful degradation)
```

### 2. Write Post-Mortem

Use template: `docs/templates/post-mortem.md`

**Sections:**

- **What happened?** (timeline + user impact)
- **Root cause analysis** (why did it happen?)
- **What went well?** (positive aspects)
- **What could improve?** (gaps, delays)
- **Action items** (prevent recurrence)

**Timeline for post-mortem:**

- Critical incidents: Within 24 hours
- Warning incidents: Within 1 week
- Info: Optional

### 3. Update Runbooks

Improve runbooks based on learnings:

- **Add missing steps** found during incident
- **Clarify confusing sections** that slowed response
- **Add new prevention measures**
- **Update commands** if syntax changed
- **Fix broken links**
- **Add new tools/dashboards** used

**Mark runbook as reviewed:**

```markdown
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31
**Reviewed By:** [Your name] (after [incident ID])
**Next Review:** 2026-04-30
```

### 4. Share Learnings

- **Team meeting:** Discuss incident and learnings (blameless)
- **Update training materials:** Add to onboarding if relevant
- **External communication:** Status page update if public impact
- **Stakeholder update:** Inform leadership if major incident

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Monthly Review

At end of each month:

- [ ] Review all incidents from past month
- [ ] Identify patterns (recurring issues)
- [ ] Measure MTTR trends (improving or degrading?)
- [ ] Update runbooks based on learnings
- [ ] Add new runbooks for new incident types
- [ ] Check if alerts are actionable (too many false positives?)
- [ ] Verify escalation paths worked

**Metrics to track:**

- Total incidents (by severity)
- MTTR (mean time to recovery)
- Alert accuracy (true vs false positives)
- Runbook usage (which runbooks used most)
- Escalation rate (% of incidents escalated)

### Quarterly Audit

Every 3 months:

- [ ] **Test runbooks in staging environment**
  - Follow steps exactly as written
  - Verify all commands work
  - Update if anything changed

- [ ] **Verify all links and commands still work**
  - Dashboard URLs
  - API endpoints
  - CLI commands
  - External services

- [ ] **Update screenshots** if UI changed

- [ ] **Peer review:**
  - Someone who hasn't used runbook before
  - Fresh eyes catch unclear steps
  - Validate MTTR estimates

- [ ] **Conduct incident response drill:**
  - Simulate production incident
  - Follow runbooks
  - Measure response time
  - Identify gaps

   - Related resources (links)

3. **Test steps in staging environment:**
   - Verify commands work
   - Check links are valid
   - Estimate MTTR accurately

4. **Peer review:**

   - Update runbook count at bottom

6. **Update alert mappings:**
   - If runbook corresponds to alert, document it
   - Link from alert to runbook in alerting system

### Updating Existing Runbook

After using a runbook during incident:

1. **Make changes** based on incident learnings
   - Add missing steps
   - Clarify unclear sections
   - Update commands if changed
   - Fix errors

2. **Add "Last Updated" date:**

   ```markdown
   **Last Updated:** 2026-01-31

4. **Notify team:**
   - Post in `#kingston-ops`
   - Summarize changes
   - Tag relevant people

### Runbook Quality Standards

All runbooks must meet these standards:

- **Clarity:** Steps are clear and unambiguous
- **Completeness:** No assumed knowledge
- **Accuracy:** Commands tested and working
- **Actionable:** Specific steps, not vague advice
- **Timed:** MTTR estimate is realistic
- **Current:** Updated within last 6 months
- **Linked:** All references are valid links

**Before publishing:**

- [ ] Tested in staging environment
- [ ] Peer reviewed by another engineer
- [ ] Links verified (no 404s)
- [ ] Commands tested (copy-paste ready)
- [ ] MTTR estimated (based on test)

## FAQ

**Q: What if runbook doesn't cover my incident?**
A: Use best judgment, follow similar runbook as guide, document steps, create new runbook after.

**Q: Should I update runbook during incident?**
A: No, focus on resolving incident. Document gaps, update runbook after resolution.

**Q: What if runbook steps don't work?**
A: Skip to escalation section, document what was tried, get help.

**Q: How do I know which runbook to use?**
A: Check alert type (Slack message), use alert → runbook mapping table above.

**Q: What if multiple problems at once?**
A: Triage by severity (critical first), escalate if overwhelmed, document timeline.

**Q: Should I follow runbook exactly?**
A: Use as guide, adapt if needed, document deviations, update runbook after.
